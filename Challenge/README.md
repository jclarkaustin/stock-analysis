# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

This project evaluates stock data for two separate years (2017 and 2018) in their specific Excel spreadsheet. It organizes an array of stocks and visualizes that data into an easier to read table in a separate worksheet.

### Purpose
The purpose of this effort is to show Steve and his parents how specific stocks performed over the course of two years. With this information they may be able to make a better decision on how to invest their money.

### Analysis for 2017

All evaluated stocks had positive returns with the exception of TERP which had a negative return of -7.2%. The top three performing stocks were DQ (199.4%), SEDG (184.5%), and ENPH (129.5%)

### Analysis for 2018

The reverse can be said for 2018. All stocks had losses except for ENPH (81.9%) and RUN (84.0%)

## Analysis Run Times

- Is there a run time difference between each year? Not an extensive one, but some refactoring could be done.

Summary: ENPH had positive returns over two years and could be a better choice for investment. Past performance is not an indication of future results.
